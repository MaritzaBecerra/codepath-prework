Submitted by: Maritza Becerra

Time spent: 15 hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [MB] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [MB] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [MB] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [MB] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [MB] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [MB] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [MB] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [MB] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [MB] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [MB] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [MB] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [MB] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [MB] Confetti is thrown if won game
- [MB] Song is played if won
- [MB] Sound is made if lose
- [MB] About Me page
- [MB] Navigation bar
- [MB] Dark Mode

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
    -W3Schools: for a majority of things
		-Partner: for simple help

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
    -A challenge I faced throughout this project was the overwhelming feeling that I could add so many features to it. While scrolling through W3Schools, I kept finding new things to add, and it was a bit hectic because I wanted to try to add everything, but with time constraints and the newness of everything, I wasn't able to. I had to step away and set a detailed list of what exactly I wanted and break that list into things I could do in a short amount of time, and put the others on the back burner (hopefully still add in the future). 
	Also, I had a struggle with how to format the code because of all the features I kept wanting to put in. I will not lie on W3Schools, the code snippets were formated a bit odd as I'm used to Java and C++, so having a sort of different "classes" was a bit difficult to grasp as each "class" did something different. For instance, I knew HTML was more formating, CSS is more colors and sizes, and JavaScript is more function calls. I had to take it step by step and read up about what order and where everything should go. I also used my partner as a resource as she had some web development experience.
	I would say there is more I can improve from these challenges I faced. For instance, I wanted to include sound when the player won or lost, and by the time I figured out how to do it, I didn't want to mess with my HTML code, so I found a way to add sound solely through JavaScript. Everything is a learning experience, and as Miley Cyrus said, "there's always gonna be another mountain, I'm always gonna wanna make it move."

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
    -I have quite a bit of questions mostly revolving around the everyday life of a web developer, such as "how long does it usually take for a full website to be constructed from start to finish?" For me, it took me a lot longer than expected because of the newness; however, I assume it could take months or even years because of new features a client might want or even features that people come up with.
	Another question for a developer is what are the most common challenges people face, whether that be from the developer themselves or the clients as well, and how one would go about "making the client happy." Additionally, how long does it take to get used to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because I know what each one does, but I still have to go to each file to make sure. I am almost 100% certain it just takes practice but is there a trick or acronym that may ease the difficulty.
	A question over implementing features such as making the website ADA accessible by adding features to increase text for hard of seeing or a text to speech for blind clients. I know most websites are not accessible to those who may need them most, and I want to be able to help those by implementing the example features. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
    -If I had a few more hours, I would fix features that I implemented, for instance, the dark mode on the navigation screen. I would have liked to have added a "light mode" when the dark mode was turned on. Additionally, making the game more aesthetically pleasing would have been nice, for example, adding some borders to the screen size and a header background, so the text would stand out more. Another cool thing I wanted to add was little graphics at the bottom of the screen, such as a little Tardis flying, as I wanted to base my game on Doctor Who. To go with the theme, it would have also been nice to add pictures of the 9th-12th doctors as the button with the theme song of those doctors as the button sounds. One main thing I wanted to implement was instead of the alert box; it would be the entire screen saying you had either won or lost. To go with that, I would have also added a prompt box to enter your name to make the win and lose screen more unique. The main thing I would fix is my code formatting. Once I saw what features I could add, I went a little crazy, and my formatting went all over the place. 
	On the other hand, if I had a few more days, I would have added different versions of the light and sound game in the navigation bar, such as a simple mode, cartoon (Johnny Test) mode, movie (How to Train your Dragon) mode, and it would include the same features and the features I wanted to implement, but they would all go with the theme.
